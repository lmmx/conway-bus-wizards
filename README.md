# Conway's bus wizards

Following my hunch on the Conway bus wizards problem:

> Last night I sat behind two wizards on a bus, and overheard the following:
>
> A: “I have a positive integral number of children, whose ages are positive
> integers, the sum of which is the number of this bus, while the product is
> my own age.” 
> B: “How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your
> children, I could work out their individual ages?”  
> A: “No.”  
> B: “Aha! AT LAST I know how old you are!”  
>  
> Now what was the number of the bus?

By my calculations the answer is given in this file: [answer.md](answer.md)

**Update:** my hunch is not correct: we must assume that both wizards know
the number of the bus they are travelling on, which my tentative answer
was relying on upon closer inspection! I've increased my range of ages
to search for more results and am calling it quits for the night…
